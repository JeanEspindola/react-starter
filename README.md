## A sample repository to start a new react application

It requires Node.JS and NPM to be installed in your computer.

Follow these instructions to start and run the application, using your preferred Terminal:

1. Run ``npm install`` to install all project and development dependencies.
    * Here we install the react and react-dom core packages as project dependencies.
    * In the development dependencies, we intall all babel packages used compile JSX to Javascript.
    * Also installed, webpack, used to complete the transformation and start a local server.

2. Run ``npm run build`` to build the application
    * In other words, this npm script will make the webpack to perform the transformations.

3. Run ``npm run start`` to start a local server
    * This script will also watch for any change inside the project and reload automatically.

4. Open a new browser tab and navigate to ``http://localhost:8080``
    * Enjoy!!
