# react-starter
A sample repository to start a new react application

It requires Node.JS and NPM to be installed in your computer.

Follow these instructions to start and run the application, using your preferred Terminal:
<ol>
    <li>Run ``npm install`` to install all project and development dependencies.</li>
    Here we install the react and react-dom core packages as project dependencies.
    In the development dependencies, we intall all babel packages used compile JSX to Javascript.
    Also installed, webpack, used to complete the transformation and start a local server.
    <br />
    <li>Run ``npm run build`` to build the application</li>
    In other words, this npm script will make the webpack to perform the transformations.
    <br />
    <li>Run ``npm run start`` to start a local server</li>
    This script will also watch for any change inside the project and reload automatically.
    <li>Open a new browser tab and navigate to ``http://localhost:8080``</li>
    Enjoy!!
</ol>
